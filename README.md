# This is LeetCode’s 30 Days of JavaScript/TypeScript Challenge

This is a challenge to myself to consistently implement solutions to problems. I'm looking into pushing myself and finding out where my limits are
with enough time and strict dedication. It's also a good point to see when my mind breaks from writing code every day.

## What happens after 30 days?

Although my goal is to reach the 30-day challenge without minimal days missed, I assume I'll miss one or two. That said, it will be at a heavy
cost to my sanity. Each day I miss within this 30-day window will be met with 2 extra days added to my challenge.
The idea is to see how long I can be consistent, with minimal punishment, before I graduate in December. 

## What's motivating me to do this?

Honestly, I hate doing LeetCode questions. They make me feel like I'm in detention. It is that exact reason that I am going to do it. I
have had something of a ‘writer’s block' in terms of projects to complete. Projects that I'm proud of, and my private repo is a sea of
unfinished wonders. My directory, even more so. I'll get an idea, and hit a technical roadblock. I'll look up solutions, and nothing
will work. My mindset has changed over the last couple of months. Instead of worrying about 'finishing the perfect project', I've decided
that every bit of coding will inevitably help me reach my ultimate goal. Be better than I was yesterday.

## What's your goal here?

My goal isn't to be the best, it's to improve and achieve my own goals and see what I've done and be proud that I made the journey in the first place.
